# BellaBeat_FitBit_DataAnalysis
Introduction

Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform various real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I imagine myself working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and interacting with different team members as part of my final step to earn the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification.

To address the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process:

Ask
Prepare
Process
Analyze
Share
Act

Along the way, I will use the Case Study Roadmap tables, which include guiding questions and key tasks.
