# GoogleDataAnalytics_CaseStudy
Introduction

Welcome to the Bellabeat data analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data
analyst. I will imagine I am working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, and
meet different characters and team members as part of my final step to get my Google Data Analytics professional certification. In order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the
data analysis process: 
  1.ask 
  2.prepare
  3.process 
  4.analyze
  5.share
  6.act. 
Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables â€”
including guiding questions and key tasks.
