# BellaBeat_FitBit_DataAnalysis
## Project Overview
This project is part of my journey towards earning the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. In this case study, I assume the role of a junior data analyst working for Bellabeat, a company that designs high-tech health-focused products for women. The goal of the analysis is to extract valuable insights from a Fitbit dataset to address key business questions.

Throughout the project, I follow the standard data analysis process:

#### Ask: Define the business questions.
#### Prepare: Gather and clean the data.
#### Process: Prepare the data for analysis.
#### Analyze: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns.
#### Share: Visualize findings and prepare a report.
#### Act: Provide actionable recommendations.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Fitbit data available on Kaggle: [Fitbit Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a full data analysis workflow, from data cleaning to generating insights. Check out the project files to see the code, visualizations, and detailed reports!
